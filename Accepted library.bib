  abstract = {The hole-drilling behaviour of the common octopus in North Chilean waters, Octopus mimus, on nine of its molluscan prey was studied in 70 specimens of 10--2000 g body weight in the laboratory. The occurrence of perforation was low, only 24.50\% of the ingested prey were drilled. The bivalve Protothaca thaca (Molina) was the prey most frequently perforated, on 73.30\% of occasions. The mean length of the P. thaca ingested increased significantly with octopus weight (r2=0.982, p{$<$}0.001) whether or not clams had previously been drilled. The form of the holes was usually a truncated cone with an oval section. The dimensions (length and width) of the external openings of the holes were significantly dependent on octopus weight and clam length (p{$<$}0.001 in both cases). However, the dimensions of the internal openings of the holes were only dependent on octopus size. Location of the holes differed according to the prey species. Holes made in Mytilidae shells did not have any specific position, while the apex was the area selected for drilling the gastropod Concholepas concholepas (Brugi{\`e}re). The most specific location occurred when Protothaca thaca was perforated; 83\% of the holes were located within or close to the myostracum of the anterior, mainly, and posterior adductor muscles of the clam. Within these small areas, there was a preference for the proximal edges.},

  abstract = {Most studies of the feeding habits of octopuses have focused on the use of a single technique, often selected on the basis of its familiarity or minimal impact on study animals. Although over time new methods have been developed for dietary assessment, no comparative analysis has ever been done. Using Octopus insularis as a model, we examined the results of three methods of diet analysis to understand how these techniques can influence study conclusions. Octopus diets were assessed through the analysis of (1) fresh prey remains deposited in midden piles, (2) digestive contents from the octopus crop and stomach, and (3) stable isotope data on the octopus and its potential food sources. The research was conducted at Rocas Atoll, a pristine oceanic reef o the northeastern coast of Brazil, with data from a coastal environment with substantial human impact (i.e. Rio do Fogo, northeastern Brazil) being evaluated as well. Overall, the three methods di ered in the type of data they produced and the timescale represented, reflecting their own biases, the biology and behaviour of the octopus, and even the local oceanographic and other environmental conditions. We therefore provide a conceptual diagram to help researchers to consider the inherent aspects of each method when planning and performing studies of octopus diet, and also when interpreting study results.},

  abstract = {Observations were made with scuba on the diet and behavior of 18 species of undisturbed sea stars in their natural habitats along the shores of Washington state through all seasons. Some sea stars are specialists. Hippasteria spinosa feeds almost exclusively on a sea pen; Solaster stimpsoni eats holothurians; full-sized Orthasterias koehleri consume the venerid clam Huminilaria; Solaster dazosoni eats its congener S. stimpsoni. Others show remarkably variable diets. In different habitats, Dermasterias imbricate specializes on either anemones, holothurians or sea pens, but within these habitats its diet is consistent throughout the year. The diet of Mediaster aequalis varies with both habitat and season. Pycnopodia helianthoides feeds on sea urchins on rocky substrata but digs clams from sand and cobble. Many other sea stars, including Luidia foliolata, Pteraster tesselatus, Pisaster ochraceus, Evasterias troschelii and Leptasterias hexactis, are quite generalized in their diet and, though often demonstrating preferences in laboratory studies, will feed on a variety of prey determined largely by relative abundance of prey species in the particular habitat. The areal and seasonal variation in the diet of sea stars coupled with the reluctance of some to eat any prey in the laboratory makes extension of laboratory observations to the field diet suspect. Laboratory observations can be used to provide a more detailed understanding of field observations.},

  abstract = {Understanding the effects of predator--prey interactions at a community level requires robust information on the mechanisms determining these interactions at the individual level. Here we use the intertidal crab Eriphia verrucosa (Forsk{\aa}l) as a model species to examine patterns of association between functional morphology (cheliped size and form) and patterns of prey consumption on shores of differing exposure to wave action. The size and form of the cheliped of crabs are known to be related to feeding performance and thus influence the outcomes for prey assemblages. Multivariate analyses showed that the claw size and shape of E. verrucosa varied between shores of differing exposure to wave action. Individuals from exposed locations had larger claws than those from sheltered locations. This shift in size was accompanied by differences in the composition of stomach contents between locations. Crabs from exposed shores had {$\sim$} 55\% more hard shell prey (mussels and limpets) in their diet than those from sheltered shores. Crabs were more abundant on sheltered shores, but those from exposed locations were larger in carapace width. The relative abundance of prey varied between shores of differing exposure. Patterns of claw functional morphology provided a mechanistic explanation for the differences in prey consumption along the wave exposure gradient, although it remains to be tested whether there is a phenotypic plasticity response of crab claw to patterns of prey consumption. The interaction between prey abundance and morphology of the cheliped will likely shape the diet of this crab species, and this may have implications for the relative impact of this predator between shores of differing exposure.},

  abstract = {Patterns of feeding in a population of Heliaster helianthus (Lamarck), a common and dominant species of starfish indigenous to the Pacific South American coast, were investigated in an intertidal habitat in central Peru from October 1986 to April 1987. The H. helianthus population comprised individuals of 3.5 to 30.2 cm body size (diameter) with two modal size classes. The number of rays ranged between 18 and 40, and individuals with 31 to 33 rays accounted for ca. 42\% of the total population. There was a higher rate of increase in ray number with body size amongst small individuals({$<$}13.0 cm diam). H. helianthus is capable of feeding on more than one prey item at a time (average of 5.6 to 13.2 prey items handled, with several predators observed to hold {$>$}100), and both the number of prey individuals captured and the total prey biomass were significantly correlated with predator size. Amongst a total of 1132 feeding observations, the largest number of predators (an average of 85.4\% of those feeding) were preying on the mussel Semimytilus algosus whilst another mussel, Perumytilus purpuratus, ranked second with 21,9\% of predators feeding. The proportion of S. algosus in the diet increased from 65.4\% in the smallest predator size-group ({$\leq$}10.9 cm diam) to 91.2\% in the largest ({$\geq$}19.0 cm). In contrast, P. purpuratus and barnacles were more highly represented in the diet of small H. helianthus. The smallest size-group ({$\leq$}10.9 cm) had low dietary overlap with larger sizes and less specialized prey utilization. Two geographically separated populations of H. helianthus in Peru and Chile showed contrasting patterns of prey utilization. S. algosus and P. purpuratus comprised 85.5 and 6.5\% by number in the diet of the Peruvian population, respectively, whilst corresponding figures for the Chilean population were 8.3 and 60.5\%, with barnacles attaining a higher share (22.6\%). However, the total number of prey individuals per feeding predator was almost the same in Peru and Chile, with 10.0 and 10.7 individuals, respectively. H. helianthus individuals of different sizes occupy slightly different microhabitats within the intertidal area, which, coupled with differential spatial distribution of prey species, results in the predator population being able to utilize a wide range of resources.},

  abstract = {The behavior of the octopus when feeding upon shelled molluscs is described in four steps: selection of prey, boring a hole in the shell, secreting into the borehole, and pulling out the body oC the mollusc and eating it. Selection of some gastropod prey is determined by a firm, deep, either partial or complete obstruction in the aperture of the shell. Selection of other prey, gastropods, pelecypods, and amphineurans, may be based upon resistance by the mollusc to the application of force by the octopus. Drilling of the hole is done by the radula. Since the octopus will drill and secrete into empty shells with obstructions in the apertures, metabolites from a live mollusc are unnecessary. This technique can be usedto collect the secretion. The frequency of occurrence and the eflect of the secretion are discussed. The hypothesis that the octopus first tries by force to pull out the body and, failing to do so, drills a hole in the shell is experimentally supported.The conditions under which the octopus drills or pulls out the body of the mollusc are incompletely understood. The octopus may drill two or more shells in succession without feeding upon the previously drilled and weakened snail. No two steps in the behavioral sequence are necessarily linked to each other. The drilling-feeding patterns are complex and plastic.},
