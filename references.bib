  abstract = {Molluscan grazers can have important effects on the abundance, colonization rates, and successional pathways of algal assemblages and the entire intertidal community. In general, early successional algae are more readily consumed than corticated algae and kelps, which usually get established later in the community succession. To generalize, however, the effect of different grazers on algal assemblages must be examined on different coasts and under different scenarios. This information could help us understand the mechanisms of ecosystem processes and situations in which general models do not apply. Along the coast of Chile, humans harvest large keyhole limpets, which seem to be the only invertebrate grazers capable of controlling the dominant corticated alga Mazzaella laminarioides, a canopy-forming species that can cover extensive areas of the mid intertidal zone. In this scenario, where large limpets are harvested, the overall effects of the diverse molluscan assemblage of limpets, chitons and snails on algal succession and on corticated algae in particular are not clear. We conducted a 26-month-long experiment to evaluate the effects of molluscan grazers on mid-intertidal algal succession and to isolate the effects of Chiton granosus, the most conspicuous member of the assemblage at these tidal elevations. At sites heavily impacted by humans the molluscan grazer assemblage had strong negative effects on colonization and abundance of green algae such as ulvoids and Blidingia minima. In doing so, the grazer assemblage had a strong negative indirect effect on the establishments of chironomid fly larvae, which were only observed on green algal mats and rarely on bare rock. No significant effects were detected on epilithic microalgae, and effects on sessile invertebrates were highly variable over space and time. C. granosus also had significant negative effects on green algae but did not account for the total grazing pressure exerted by the guild. Limited foraging excursions (ca. 35 cm) from refuges and moderate site (crevice) fidelity in this species may contribute to the patchiness in green algal distribution observed in the field. Nearly 13 months after rock surface were experimentally cleared, M. laminarioides appeared in all experimental plots, but increased over three times faster in enclosures containing C. granosus than in exclosures plots or controls, suggesting that moderate levels of herbivory could actually facilitate the establishment of this alga in the succession and that the green algal cover found in the absence of grazers may delay its establishment.},

  abstract = {Despite the great interest in characterizing the functional structure and resilience of functional groups in natural communities, few studies have examined in which way the roles and relationships of coexisting species change during community succession, a fundamental and natural process that follows the release of new resources in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Variation in algal traits that characterize different phases and stages of community succession on rocky shores are likely to influence the magnitude, direction of effects, and the level of redundancy and complementarity in the diverse assemblage of herbivores. Two separate field experiments were conducted to quantify per capita and population effects and the functional relationship (i.e., redundancy or complementarity) of four herbivore species found in central Chile during early and late algal succession. The first experiment examined grazer effects on the colonization and establishment of early-succession algal species. The second experiment examined effects on the late-successional, dominant corticated alga Mazzaella laminarioides. Complementary laboratory experiments with all species and under natural environmental conditions allowed us to further characterize the collective effects of these species. We found that, during early community succession, all herbivore species had similar effects on the ephemeral algae, ulvoids, but only during the phase of colonization. Once these algae were established, only a subset of the species was able to control their abundance. During late succession, only the keyhole limpet Fissurella crassa could control corticated Mazzaella. The functional relationships among these species changed dramatically from redundant effects on ephemeral algae during early colonization, to a more complementary role on established early-successional algae, to a dominant (i.e., keystone) effect on late succession. This study highlights that functional relationship within consumer assemblages can vary at different phases and times of community succession. Differentiation in herbivore roles emphasizes the need to evaluate consumer's impacts through different times of community succession, and through experimental manipulations to make even broad predictions about the resilience or vulnerability of diverse intertidal assemblages to human disturbances.},

  abstract = {There is a general consensus that marine herbivores can affect algal species composition and abundance, but little empirical work exists on the role of herbivores as modifiers of the spatial structure of resource assemblages. Here, we test the consumption/bulldozing effects of the molluscan grazer Enoplochiton niger and its influence on the spatial structure of a low intertidal community dominated by the bull kelp Durvillaea antarctica and the kelp Lessonia spicata. Through field experiments conducted at a rocky intertidal shore in north-central Chile ({\textasciitilde}30{$^\circ$}-32{$^\circ$}S), the edge of the grazer and algae geographic distributions, we estimated the strength and variability of consumptive effects of the grazer on different functional group of algae. We also used data from abundance field surveys to evaluate spatial co-occurrence patterns of the study species. Exclusion-enclosure experiments showed that E. niger maintained primary space available by preventing algal colonization, even of large brown algae species. The grazing activity of E. niger also reduced spatial heterogeneity of the ephemeral algal species, increasing bare space availability and variability through time in similar ways to those observed for the collective effect with other grazers. Overall, our result suggests that E. niger can be considered an important modifier of the spatial structure of the large brown algae-dominated community. Effects of E. niger on resource variability seem to be directly related to its foraging patterns, large body size, and population densities, which are all relevant factors for management and conservation of the large brown algae community. Our study thus highlights the importance of considering functional roles and identity of generalist consumers on spatial structure of the entire landscape.},

  abstract = {Conservation efforts for endangered animals commonly focus on the protection of foraging habitats, aiming to ensure sufficient food availability. However, the diet of many species is based on animals that undergo habitat shifts across ontogenetic life stages, yielding considerable differences between the lifelong habitat requirements of both predator and prey. Consequently, prey availability may not only depend on the suitability of the foraging grounds where predator and prey coincide, but also on habitats where the ecological requirements of the non-prey stages are fulfilled. In this study we test to what extent prey of the insectivorous bat Rhinolophus euryale (Blasius 1853) originate either from the grounds where they are consumed, or in areas/habitats outside the bat's foraging sites. We analyzed the diet of R. euryale, by identifying its prey to the species level using DNA metabarcoding, and by searching for its prey's larval feeding requirements in the literature. We found that the larvae of the moth prey grow both inside and outside the grounds where they are hunted by the bats once the moths reach their adult stage. The importance of prey that originated from outside the bat's foraging grounds varied considerably across seasons. As a result, R. euryale does not only rely on the landscape elements where it hunts, but also on other source areas/habitats that supply it with food. This study shows that conservation measures that aim to address the foraging requirements of predatory species should not be limited to merely protecting their foraging grounds, but should also take into account the ecological requirements of their prey throughout their life stages.},

  abstract = {Rocky intertidal environments are important feeding, growth and reproduction areas to a variety  of benthic organisms. These ecosystems can be found worldwide and their benthos'  composition and temporal and spatial patterns are influenced by environmental and biological  factors. Most studies on these environments have focused on rocky shores of temperate and  subtropical regions. On the other hand, there is a lack of studies in other rocky formations and  tropical regions, specially testing proper methodologies that are suitable for greater substrate  heterogeneity and lower slope. This study had three main objectives: 1) to identify the main  types of method used for quantifying benthonic organisms, using scientometric analysis; and,  in tropical sedimentary reefs: 2) to test random and stratified quadrats and transects with  quadrats to test the survey method that best represent richness of molluscs and echinoderms in  these environments; 3) and, after determining the most suitable survey method, to test which  environmental factors influence occurrence, abundance and richness of these organisms, and  test whether there is seasonal variation of abundance of taxa. The organisms' mobility was one  of the determinant factors when choosing benthonic survey method in the analyzed papers.  Quadrats and transects with quadrats were the main methods used to delimit areas for counting  of mobile individuals and estimation of sessile cover. On the selected tropical reefs for the  methodological tests, random transects with quadrats showed better richness results with less  sampling effort, including sampling under boulders when they were present. Substrate cover,  reef typology, habitat complexity and exposure time were the main environmental factors  determining the structure of communities over the reefs. Substrate cover, habitat complexity  and exposure time were the main factors structuring communities under boulders. Regarding  organisms' abundance between the different seasons, Pugilina tupiniquim, Holothuria grisea  and Cerithium sp were indicative taxa of the rainy season and Aplysia dactylomela was  indicative taxa of the dry season in sheltered reefs with rocky blocks.},

  abstract = {Aposematic species signal their unpalatability to potential predators with recognizable, and frequently conspicuous, colour patterns. These visual signals are often also associated with bold behaviour and a reduced propensity to escape from approaching predators. Bold behaviours may act as an aversive signal and allow defended prey to avoid the energetic/opportunity costs that arise from fleeing predators. For Batesian mimics, non-defended species which replicate the colours of defended models, behavioural mimicry may also improve mimic fidelity and reduce energetic/opportunity costs. However, as predators may test the honesty of aposematic signals through sampling behaviour, Batesian mimics can be at high risk during close-range interactions with predators. This raises the question of whether/when Batesian mimics should deviate from behavioural mimicry and initiate more extensive escape behaviour. Here, we exposed the chemically defended poison frog Ameerega bilinguis and its (non-toxic) Batesian mimic Allobates zaparo to a simulated predator encounter. We predicted Al. zaparo would escape to a greater distance and in a more erratic manner than Am. bilinguis. Yet, contrary to our predictions, Al. zaparo did not flee far from predators. It was, however, more likely to initiate escape prior to physical contact from the predator. We suggest that bold behaviour coupled with pre-emptive movement allows Al. zaparo to retain the benefits of behavioural mimicry while reducing the likelihood that predators will test signal honesty. Our data highlight that when examining the evolution of mimicry, we must consider both morphological and behavioural traits, as well as how risk to the prey may change how they behave throughout the predation sequence.},

I. niveus is recorded for the first time for Brazil and C. isabellae is recorded for the first time for the northeastern coast of the country. The irregular distribution of chitons in the ecosystem studied may be related to both the habits of the species and environmental influences. The findings of the present study suggest that chitons have a preference for seagrasses due to the abundant rocky substrates around the meadow for their establishment.

Is the abundance, distribution, habitat and diet of this species on the continent the same as in oceanic islands? These factors were evaluated in seeking these answers at two areas of occurrence of Octopus insularis on the coast of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. Three main types of habitats were described where the species is concentrated, being: Deep Reefs (Reefs of Risca) ({$>$} 15 m), Flat Biogenic Plateaus (Restingas) (5-15 m) and Shallow Sedimentary Reefs (Pirangi reefs) ({$<$} 5 m). An aggregate spatial distribution was verified, along with bathymetric segregation in which small individuals occupied shallow areas. Regarding diet, O. insularis consumed mainly crustaceans (68\%) in shallow reef areas, bivalves (86\%) in biogenic plateau areas, and gastropods (33\%) in deep reef areas. The characterization of new occurring habitats, such as the area of biogenic plateau, and changes in their diet due to habitat function have shown that O. insularis occupies a broader niche than has been described in literature to date, expanding our knowledge on the ecology and biology of this octopus species of economic interest.},

The ranking of its four main prey types did not vary annually. Numerically, the prey comprised 50--75\% limpets, 14--34\% mussels, 8--18\% chitons, 1--2\% Northern Abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana), and \&lt;1\% other species. In 2009, we estimated prey availability and prey preference by Ivlev's electivity index. Northern Abalone, limpets, and chitons were highly preferred; mussels, turban snails, and barnacles were taken in proportion to their occurrence or avoided. Black Oystercatchers preferred abalone of 50 mm, smaller than the mean size available, in contrast to the selection of larger-than-average prey, typical for other prey species. In 2010, 52\% of nesting territories sampled contained remains of Northern Abalone, despite that species' small contribution to the diet. The Northern Abalone has never been reported as prey of the Black Oystercatcher despite its high vulnerability to predation at low tides. We speculate that the recent inclusion of the Northern Abalone in the Black Oystercatcher diet on Haida Gwaii may indicate a greater abundance of Northern Abalone than in other regions of its distribution. The frequency of the oystercatcher's feeding on abalone was unexpected because under Canada's Species at Risk Act, the Northern Abalone was listed as ``endangered'' in 2010, after the population continued to decline after legal protection from harvest in 1990.},

The highly diverse diet was made up primarily of macroalgae and benthic invertebrates that were either sessile or had little mobility. The most important prey were the seaweeds Laminariaceae (43\% of the frequency of occurrence and 15\% of the food dry weight), Corallina spp. (38\% and 3\%), molluscs [the chiton Acanthochitona crinitus (15\% and 1\%), the gastropods Bittium sp.

The variability in diet composition was determined by the season (Laminariaceae, Corallina spp., P. lividus, Mytilus sp., gastropods and chitons appeared in greater frequency in winter, while the solitary ascidians and A. lefevrei were consumed to a greater extent in summer) in addition to sexual maturity (prey such as Bittium sp. or Trochiidae were more common in juveniles). Moreover, the changes in the food consumption rate were linked primarily to the moult stage. Feeding activity plummeted during the phases immediately preceding and following ecdysis (stages D0--D3--4 and A), and the diet was less diverse during these phases. No feeding differences were found that could be linked to sex. The composition of the diet of Maja squinado appears to be determined by the seasonal abundance of the different prey in subtidal rocky areas and by their availability (depending on their behavioural and anatomical characteristics, mainly mobility and the presence of hard external structures). Moreover, life history factors have little importance in the variability of the diet composition and only the moult cycle has a considerable effect on feeding rate.},

  abstract = {Predation is an interaction during which an organism kills and feeds on another organism. Past and current interest in studying predation in terrestrial habitats has yielded a number of methods to assess invertebrate predation events in terrestrial ecosystems. We provide a decision tree to select appropriate methods for individual studies. For each method, we then present a short introduction, key examples for applications, advantages and disadvantages, and an outlook to future refinements. Video and, to a lesser extent, live observations are recommended in studies that address behavioral aspects of predator--prey interactions or focus on per capita predation rates. Cage studies are only appropriate for small predator species, but often suffer from a bias via cage effects. The use of prey baits or analyses of prey remains are cheaper than other methods and have the potential to provide per capita predation estimates. These advantages often come at the cost of low taxonomic specificity. Molecular methods provide reliable estimates at a fine level of taxonomic resolution and are free of observer bias for predator species of any size. However, the current PCR-based methods lack the ability to estimate predation rates for individual predators and are more expensive than other methods. Molecular and stable isotope analyses are best suited to address systems that include a range of predator and prey species. Our review of methods strongly suggests that while in many cases individual methods are sufficient to study specific questions, combinations of methods hold a high potential to provide more holistic insights into predation events. This review presents an overview of methods to researchers that are new to the field or to particular aspects of predation ecology and provides recommendations toward the subset of suitable methods to identify the prey of invertebrate predators in terrestrial field research.},

  abstract = {In this work, we investigate the dynamics of a discrete-time prey--predator model considering a prey reproductive response as a function of the predation risk, with the prey population growth factor governed by two parameters. The system can evolve toward scenarios of mutual or only of predators extinction, or species coexistence. We analytically show all different types of equilibrium points depending on the ranges of growth parameters. By numerical study, we find the occurrence of quasiperiodic, chaotic, and hyperchaotic behaviors. Our analytical results are corroborated by the numerical ones. We highlight Arnold tongue-like periodic structures organized according to the Farey sequence, as well as pairs of twin shrimps connected by two links. The mathematical model captures two possible prey responsive strategies, decreasing or increasing the reproduction rate under predatory threat. Our results support that both strategies are compatible with the populations coexistence and present rich dynamics.},

The extent to which octopuses discriminate prey using chemo- versus mechano-tactile sensing is unknown. We developed a whole-animal behavioral assay that takes advantage of octopuses' natural searching behavior to test their ability to discriminate prey from non-prey tastes solely via contact chemoreception. This methodology eliminated vision, mechano-tactile sensing and distance chemoreception while testing the contact chemosensory discriminatory abilities of the octopus arm suckers. Extracts from two types of prey (crab, shrimp) and three types of non-prey (sea star, algae, seawater) were embedded in agarose (to control for mechano-tactile discrimination) and presented to octopuses inside an artificial rock dome; octopuses reached their arms inside to explore its contents - imitating natural prey-searching behavior. Results revealed that octopuses are capable of discriminating between potential prey items using only contact chemoreception,~as measured by~an increased amount of sucker contact time and arm curls when presented with prey extracts versus non-prey extracts. These results highlight the importance of contact chemoreception in the multi-modal sensing involved in a complex foraging behavior.},

  abstract = {Octopuses integrate visual, chemical and tactile sensory information while foraging and feeding in complex marine habitats. The respective roles of these modes are of interest ecologically, neurobiologically, and for development of engineered soft robotic arms. While vision guides their foraging path, benthic octopuses primarily search ``blindly'' with their arms to find visually hidden prey amidst rocks, crevices and coral heads. Each octopus arm is lined with hundreds of suckers that possess a combination of chemo- and mechanoreceptors to distinguish prey. Contact chemoreception has been demonstrated in lab tests, but mechanotactile sensing is less well characterized. We designed a non-invasive live animal behavioral assay that isolated mechanosensory capabilities of Octopus bimaculoides arms and suckers to discriminate among five resin 3D-printed prey and non-prey shapes (all with identical chemical signatures). Each shape was introduced inside a rock dome and was only accessible to the octopus' arms. Octopuses' responses were variable. Young octopuses discriminated the crab prey shape from the control, whereas older octopuses did not. These experiments suggest that mechanotactile sensing of 3D shapes may aid in prey discrimination; however, (i) chemo-tactile information may be prioritized over mechanotactile information in prey discrimination, and (ii) mechanosensory capability may decline with age.},

  abstract = {Canopy-forming plants and algae, in addition to their role as food, can positively affect higher trophic levels by providing protection from predation or stressful abiotic conditions. In the low rocky intertidal zone of the Pacific Northwest, the chiton Katharina tunicata is closely associated with the canopy-forming alga Hedophyllum sessile. In a 27-month field experiment, I used experimental devices to mimic characteristics of the Hedophyllum canopy and monitored the abundance and physiology of Katharina to determine the mechanism behind this association. The data show that this association is due to selection of shaded microhabitats by Katharina, and that neither predation nor Hedophyllum per se influenced the distribution of the chiton. Exclusion of visual predators had no effect on chiton abundance, and tests of the effects of shade independent of Hedophyllum presence indicated that the shade produced by the alga was critical to the chiton. Seasonal fluctuations in levels of 70 kDa (1.16 {\texttimes} 10-19 g) heat shock proteins (Hsp70) indicate that Katharina experience sublethal physiological stress during the spring and summer. The corresponding use of shaded areas during spring and summer low tides suggests that the chiton's distribution is limited during these seasons by the availability of refugia from sublethal abiotic stresses. Subtle variations in environmental conditions are also important to this association; the strength of the positive interaction varied annually, becoming more positive in warm summers (1998 and 2000) and neutral in a cooler summer (1999). On a finer scale, physiological measurements indicate that the response of chitons to summertime temperatures depends on both absolute temperature change and the animal's recent thermal history. In particular, the seasonal onset of daytime low tides in the spring is associated with increased Hsp70 levels, indicating that this is a significant physiological event for Katharina. The importance of facultative positive interactions that allow consumers to escape from sublethal abiotic stresses will likely be variable in time but can have large impacts on communities both by affecting the small-scale distribution of consumers over the short term and potentially by affecting the persistence of organisms over the long term.},

With the exception of boring nudibranchs, all known gastropod borers are shelled. This synthesis is concerned primarily with naticacean and muricacean borers that excavate smooth, round, beveled holes. They occur in every coastal region of the world that has been examined, and identify prey chemoreceptively. The shell penetrating mechanism includes at least an accessory boring organ (ABO) and radula. The ABO is located in three separate anatomical regions in different groups of borers: in muricaceans, in the sole of the foot antenor to the ventral pedal gland or atop the ventral pedal gland; in naticaceans, under the tip of the proboscis. Studies of the ABO of several species of naticacean and muricacean snails reveal a common ultrastructural form. An acid (possibly HOI) and unidentified chelating agents and enzymes in a hypertonic mucoid secretion released by the ABO are hypothesized to dissolve shell during hole boring. All 33 species of naticacean and muricacean snails examined possess an ABO and are shell borers; the ABO does not appear to have evolved in other shell penetrating molluscs. The role of tubular salivary glands (missing in some muricids and naticids), hypobranchial glands, and anterior pedal mucous glands in shell penetration is uncertain. Borers release paralytic substances from the hypobranchial gland, and possibly also from other glands associated with the proboscis. Gastropods known to bore holes in prey shell date from the Jurassic and perhaps the late Triassic, some two hundred million years ago. Progress is being made in the control of commercially important species of muricaceans, but not of naticaceans.},

A complex aggressive behaviour was recorded in the field when two animals came in contact at home. When competing for ownership of a resting site rival chitons may suppress their nocturnal feeding activity. Despite its strong home-related territoriality A. gemmata showed no mutual exclusion on the feeding area. The highly specialized resting habits clearly protects A. gemmata from its most important predator, the toad fish Arothron immaculatus. The behaviour of A. gemmata is compared to that of other chitons and gastropods, and the current hypotheses concerning the adaptive value of the homing behaviour in littoral molluscs are discussed.},

  abstract = {Diversity of feeding mechanisms is a hallmark of reef fishes, but the history of this variation is not fully understood. Here, we explore the emergence and proliferation of a biting mode of feeding, which enables fishes to feed on attached benthic prey. We find that feeding modes other than suction, including biting, ram biting, and an intermediate group that uses both biting and suction, were nearly absent among the lineages of teleost fishes inhabiting reefs prior to the end-Cretaceous mass extinction, but benthic biting has rapidly increased in frequency since then, accounting for about 40\% of reef species today. Further, we measured the impact of feeding mode on body shape diversification in reef fishes. We fit a model of multivariate character evolution to a dataset comprising three-dimensional body shape of 1,530 species of teleost reef fishes across 111 families. Dedicated biters have accumulated over half of the body shape variation that suction feeders have in just 18\% of the evolutionary time by evolving body shape {$\sim$}1.7 times faster than suction feeders. As a possible response to the ecological and functional diversity of attached prey, biters have dynamically evolved both into shapes that resemble suction feeders as well as novel body forms characterized by lateral compression and small jaws. The ascendance of species that use biting mechanisms to feed on attached prey reshaped modern reef fish assemblages and has been a major contributor to their ecological and phenotypic diversification.},

However, the dimensions of the internal openings of the holes were only dependent on octopus size. Location of the holes differed according to the prey species. Holes made in Mytilidae shells did not have any specific position, while the apex was the area selected for drilling the gastropod Concholepas concholepas (Brugi{\`e}re). The most specific location occurred when Protothaca thaca was perforated; 83\% of the holes were located within or close to the myostracum of the anterior, mainly, and posterior adductor muscles of the clam.

Subsequent sampling of the rubble revealed hundreds of taxa of appropriate prey items, many at high densities; the density of Cerithium litteratum, a favoured food item, was as high as 180 individuals m-2. Arthropods, especially spider crabs (Pitho spp.), were common in seagrass. Gut contents of 75 intermoult lobsters caught on offshore reefs at Biscayne National Park and Dry Tortugas National Park included a myriad of prey items, predominantly molluscs---especially gastropods (49\%), chitons (15\%), and bivalves (11\%)---and arthropods (12\%); many of the species in lobster guts were rubble dwellers, but some guts contained multiple prey peculiar to seagrass and sand. It is concluded that Panulirus argus can forage successfully wherever suitable prey items, especially molluscs, are abundant. However, where a wide range of substrata, including rubble, is available, rubble is preferred because of its abundant, accessible prey.},

Upon settlement the pueruli did not possess fully functional mouthparts, however, efficient feeding appendages appeared in the first instar juvenile (after the first moult from puerulus). From this stage the density, robustness and complexity of setation on the mouthparts, together with the size and calcification of the mouthparts increased progressively with the size of the lobster. The changes correlated well with previously observed ontogenetic changes in natural prey, from small and soft prey in early juveniles to large and well-armoured molluscs, crustaceans and echinoderms in late juveniles and adults. The efficiency of shredding and tearing food items, mostly with the second maxillipeds, increased concomitantly with lobster size, as did the ability of the mandibles to grind and process food. Based on morphological and behavioural observations it is recommended that formulated feeds for first instar juvenile lobsters should be small (1--2~mm in diameter), soft and pulpy in texture to maximise feed intake. For large juvenile lobsters (45--80~mm CL), food items should increase to 5--10~mm in diameter and be of firmer consistency. Differences in feeding behaviour between spiny lobster species suggest that formulated diets developed to be efficient in one species may not be directly transferable to other species.},

However, research bias favouring species with conspicuous colours under sexual selection can limit our assessment of other ecological drivers of UV colour, like interactions between predators and prey. Here we demonstrate widespread UV colouration across Western Hemisphere snakes and find stronger support for a predator defence function than for reproduction. We find that UV colouration has evolved repeatedly in species with ecologies most sensitive to bird predation, with no sexual dichromatism at any life stage. By modelling visual systems of potential predators, we find that snake conspicuousness correlates with UV colouration and predator~cone number, providing a plausible mechanism for selection. Our results suggest that UV reflectance should not be assumed absent in ``cryptically coloured'' animals, as signalling beyond human visual capacities may be a key outcome of species interactions in many taxa for which UV colour is likely underreported.},

Although over time new methods have been developed for dietary assessment, no comparative analysis has ever been done. Using Octopus insularis as a model, we examined the results of three methods of diet analysis to understand how these techniques can influence study conclusions. Octopus diets were assessed through the analysis of (1) fresh prey remains deposited in midden piles, (2) digestive contents from the octopus crop and stomach, and (3) stable isotope data on the octopus and its potential food sources. The research was conducted at Rocas Atoll, a pristine oceanic reef o the northeastern coast of Brazil, with data from a coastal environment with substantial human impact (i.e. Rio do Fogo, northeastern Brazil) being evaluated as well. Overall, the three methods di ered in the type of data they produced and the timescale represented, reflecting their own biases, the biology and behaviour of the octopus, and even the local oceanographic and other environmental conditions. We therefore provide a conceptual diagram to help researchers to consider the inherent aspects of each method when planning and performing studies of octopus diet, and also when interpreting study results.},

  abstract = {With an exclusive diet of hard-shelled mollusks, the black drum fish (Pogonias cromis) exhibits one of the highest bite forces among extant animals. Here we present a systematic microstructural, chemical, crystallographic, and mechanical analysis of the black drum teeth to understand the structural basis for achieving the molluscivorous requirements. At the material level, the outermost enameloid shows higher modulus (Er~=~126.9 {\textpm}~16.3~GPa, H~=~5.0~{\textpm}~1.4~GPa) than other reported fish teeth, which is attributed to the stiffening effect of Zn and F doping in apatite crystals and the preferential co-alignment of crystallographic c-axes and enameloid rods along the biting direction. The high fracture toughness (Kc~=~1.12 MPa{$\cdot$}m1/2) of the outer enameloid also promotes local yielding instead of fracture during crushing contact with mollusk shells. At the individual-tooth scale, the molar-like teeth, high density of dentin tubules, enlarged pulp chamber, and specialized dentin-bone connection, all contribute to the functional requirements, including confinement of contact compressive stress in the stiff enameloid, enhanced energy absorption in the compliant dentin, and controlled failure of tooth-bone composite under excessive loads. These results show that the multi-scale structures of black drum teeth are adapted to feed on hard-shelled mollusks. Statement of significance The black drum fish feeds on hard-shelled mollusks, which requires strong, tough, and wear-resistant teeth. This study presents a comprehensive multiscale material and mechanical analysis of the black drum teeth in achieving such remarkable biological function. At microscale, the fluoride- and zinc-doped apatite crystallites in the outer enameloid region are aligned perpendicular to the chewing surface, representing one of the stiffest biomineralized materials found in nature. In the inner enameloid region, the apatite crystals are arranged into intertwisted rods with crystallographic misorientation for increased crack resistance and toughness. At the macroscale, the molariform geometry, the two-layer design based on the outer enameloid and inner dentin, enlarged pulp chamber and the underlying strong bony toothplate work synergistically to contribute to the teeth's crushing resistance.},

We compare boulder deposits created by two modern tsunami events, the 2004 Indian Ocean and the 2009 South Pacific tsunamis, where the boulder sources were in similar topographic settings, and for which we have accurate data on the wave characteristics. Boulder distribution, preferential orientation and numerical simulation of boulder transport are discussed. A comparison between the impacts of the South Pacific and Indian Ocean tsunamis shows similar characteristics, such as limited landward extent and the absence of landward fining. Differences between the results from modelling and field data are most probably caused by variables such as coastal plain roughness (buildings, trees), microtopography, particle shape, and boulder collision during transport that are summarised as coefficients in the mathematical models. Characterising modern events through coarse sediment deposits provides valuable information to help identify and interpret palaeo-tsunami imprints on coastal landscapes.},

  abstract = {Chitons of the genus Ischnochiton are found predominantly on the undersurfaces of boulders, compared with other intertidal or subtidal habitats. They therefore appear to be habitat-specialists at this scale. This, combined with the fact that boulder fields are relatively sparse compared with other intertidal habitats, makes these animals vulnerable to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. In addition, many species of Ischnochiton are relatively rare and appear to have very patchy abundances, making them likely to have very specific requirements for habitat. We need to understand the habitat requirements in order to manage, conserve and restore disturbed habitats.The present study was carried out at three intertidal boulder fields separated along approximately 200 km of the coast of New South Wales, Australia, centred around Sydney. The boulder fields were representative of those found in this region. The boulders were made of different materials: shale in the north, sandstone in Sydney and quartzitic sandstone in the south. Some boulders in each boulder field were covered by up to 0.4 m of water during low tide. The study showed that the seven species examined were overdispersed among boulders in each of these three intertidal boulder fields. Most boulders did not have associated chitons, but there were very large abundances on a very small number of boulders. Chitons were also overdispersed among boulders that they occupied. These patterns were consistent among shores and among species, even though patterns of abundance were extremely different among different species. These species appear therefore to show specific requirements for habitat at a small spatial scale, using only a small proportion of potential patches of habitat (i.e. boulders) in any place. Extremely patchy patterns of dispersion can be caused by variation in patterns of recruitment, mortality or behavioural responses to habitat or other species. Before performing experiments to investigate such processes, it is useful to test hypotheses of association with habitat using mensurative experiments to identify environmental correlates that might explain the observed patterns. In the present study, sizes of boulders and the associated sessile and mobile assemblages were proposed as mechanisms that could affect dispersion of chitons among boulders. None of these factors, however, showed strong associations with abundances of chitons. The lack of support of these models rules out some features of habitat to which species of Ischnochiton might respond, thereby precluding manipulative experiments involving these features, which are unlikely to be involved in the very patchy patterns of dispersion of species of Ischnochiton.},

This species mainly took small benthic invertebrates, including gammarids, polychaetes, sipunculids, chitons, crabs, gastropods, pelecypods and urchins from algal mats. Larger fish consumed correspondingly larger prey, although most of the latter were armored with hard exoskeletons, shells or body plates (e.g., crabs, gastropods, pelecypods and urchins). Such hard parts were crushed with the molar-like, pharyngeal teeth which develop with fish growth, allowing exploitation of such larger, hard-bodied prey. Because the densities of larger prey species were relatively low in the initial habitats foraged, larger fish shifted their foraging attention to rock and coral crevices, where the prey species dwelt in greater numbers, as well as foraging over larger areas. Such behavioral changes maintained high foraging efficiency in larger fish},

  abstract = {Foraging strategies of Glaucous---winged Gulls (Larus glaucescens) were studied in rocky intertidal habitats of the western Aleutian Islands, Alaska. Daily foraging activity was most intense at maximum low tide, and was concentrated in the lowest intertidal zones available to the birds. Barnacles (Balanus glandula) and mussels (Mytilus edulis) comprised most of the gull's diet during neap low tides, but these species were almost entirely abandoned during spring low tides in favor of sea urchins Strongylocentrotus polyacanthus), chitons (Katharina tunicata, and limpets (Collisella pelta and Notoacmaea scutum). Sea urchins, chitons, and limpets, which had positive prey selection indices, were most abundant in the lower intertidal zones; barnacles and mussels, which had negative prey selection indices, were most abundant in the upper zones. Gulls also generally selected the larger individuals from each prey species, although sea urchins larger than the commissural bill width were avoided and limpets were selected in proportion to availability. Variation in prey availability also occurred among study areas with varying densities of sea otters (Enhydra lutris). With increasing depression of invertebrate prey by sea otter predation, gulls fed on a more diverse prey resource, and they switched to neritic fishes under intense sea otter predation. Preference experiments were conducted in the field, in which the common species and sizes of prey were made equally available to foraging gulls, thus eliminating search and capture times. In comparison with natural food choice, where sea urchins were most preferred, chitons became most preferred. We suggest that chitons are infrequent in natural diets because they adhere more strongly to the substratum than do sea urchins. Benefits of selective foraging were determined by comparing the net rate of energy gain of simulated random foragers with energy gained by selection of intertidal zones, prey species, and prey sizes. Observed selection patterns provided increased energy as gulls became more selective, and averaged 155\% more than that obtained by the simulated random foragers. Results of the study support the two main predictions of optimal foraging theory in that (1) foraging patches (intertidal zones) and diets were selected such that net rates of energy gain were maximized, and (2) gulls became more selective foragers when energetically more profitable prey were more available.},

Nine different species of chitons were recorded, and their densities and sizes were determined using quadrate sampling. Physical (period of emersion, temperature and salinity range) and biotic (presence and diversity of food resources) factors were examined to assess their influence on distribution and abundance of each species. Ischnochiton dispar was the predominant species with densities of up to 200 ind m22, representing 85.4\% of all sampled individuals (N {$\frac{1}{4}$} 4193). The size of I. dispar was positively correlated with the size of the inhabited boulders. Two species (I. dispar and Stenoplax limaciformis) showed segregation in size: I. dispar being negatively and S. limaciformis positively correlated to the distance from the shore. Two of the nine species (Chiton stokesii and Acanthochitona hirundiniformis) occurred mainly on rocky areas outside the tide pools with variable amounts of exposure to air during each tidal cycle. In both species the tide pool specimens were significantly smaller than those collected in the rocky areas. Distribution of all other species was restricted to the tide pools and species had their peak abundance in the zones with more moderate conditions and a higher diversity of algae, resulting in the highest chiton diversity in these areas.},

However, feeding habits of eiders in this area have not been investigated until now. Prey selection was analyzed from 192 stomach samples (esophagus and proventriculus) collected in spring 2007--2010. Thirty-five prey species were identified; the highest percentage occurrences were of gastropods (79~\%), chitons (polyplacophorans) (58~\%), crustaceans (43~\%), bivalves (26~\%), and echinoderms (8~\%). The most common food species was the mottled red chiton Tonicella marmorea (58~\%), followed by the common whelk Buccinum undatum (40~\%), the spider crab Hyas arenarius (39~\%), and the chink shell Lacuna vincta (35~\%). The majority of the food items was of small size and consumed in high quantity. The chitons and mussels were of similar average sizes (11.7 and 13.4~mm, respectively), which might suggest that prey size could be as important as species in food selection. There were some inter-annual differences in dominant prey classes between years. For example T. marmorea was found in 60--70~\% of birds in the years 2007 and 2009 but only in 30~\% of the birds in the other years investigated. Diets of males and females were equally diverse and similar when all months and years were pooled. Prey selection was highly variable but most individuals focused on few or a single species in the hours prior to collection. Results indicate that the most common prey species for common eiders is a chiton and not blue mussels as reported elsewhere.},

This pilot study was launched by Shallow Marine Surveys Group and was aimed at investigating life history of the Antarctic starfish, Anasterias antarctica, a dominating invertebrate predator of intertidal and subtidal, including its distribution, seasonal and ontogenetic migrations, spawning seasonality, fecundity, growth, and feeding habits. A total of 3,426 starfish were sampled in different habitats around the Falkland Islands at low tide using SCUBA diving. Sampling included measuring arm length, presence/absence of brooding and feeding; the prey was identified to the lowest taxa and measured if condition permitted. In a total of 48 broods, eggs were counted and embryonic stage assigned. This medium-sized species attains an arm length of 96~mm (85.4~g). The size increased with depth and starfish carry out seasonal bathymetric migrations with smaller animals ({$<$}30~mm) being rare in waters {$>$}10~m depth in winter. Egg laying occurs between March and July, and juvenile dispersal---mostly in October--November. Fecundity (52--363 eggs) and egg/offspring size increase with maternal size. Juvenile starfish are of ca. 2~mm arm length and grow to 9--11~mm in 1~year. Feeding intensity is at a maximum before and after the reproductive period. Females might occasionally resume feeding when they are still brooding a small number of juveniles. The starfish prey upon isopods (Sphaeromatidae), molluscs Pareuthria spp. and variety of gastropods, bivalves chitons, barnacles, and also scavenges. Prey size increases with starfish size.},

At least two variations of the wedging tactic have been observed: direct wedging and a patience attack. Direct wedging involves a simple insertion of the dactyli between the prey valves. A prying effect is achieved by the pulling of one valve by the second pereiopods in tandem, while the opposite valve is pressed outward by the first pereiopods. The third pair of pereiopods is used to scrape free the attachment of the bivalve adductor muscles. Opening by the patience attack involves the probing of cemented, sessile bivalves with the pereiopods accompanied by antennal flicking. After ascertaining the precise location of the edge of the shell, the pereiopods are held poised above the shell, plunged downward upon sensing the re-opening of the shell, wedging it open. A comparison of attack tactics used by decapod crustaceans includes a number of mechanistic solutions ranging from simple, mouth-oriented tactics to more complex functional morphologies and behaviors. Specialization in a behavioral tactic may be one method for increasing prey yield despite a limited investment in armament.},

  abstract = {A predator's choice of prey can be affected by many factors. We evaluated various influences on population dietary composition, individual specialization and size of prey in Octopus insularis populations from 2 continental and 4 insular locations. We expected that habitat diversity would lead to diet heterogeneity. Furthermore, in keeping with MacArthur \& Wilson's (1967) theory of island biogeography, we expected that diet diversity would be lower around islands than on the coast of the mainland. Both predictions were confirmed when prey remains from octopus middens were examined. The 2 continental areas exhibited a richer habitat diversity and a wider variety of prey. Niche widths in the continental areas were 2.42 and 2.03, with the lowest niche widths exhibited by the population from the most distant oceanic islands (1.30, 0.85). We found variation in the proportion of specialist relative to generalist individuals across areas based on the proportional similarity index. The correlation between habitat diversity and niche width (R2 = 0.84) was highly significant, as was distance from the continental shelf and niche width (R2 = 0.89). This study reaffirms the central position of octopuses in the nearshore benthic ecosystem, and supports MacArthur \& Wilson's (1967) prediction of a lower diversity of species on islands---which applies not only to the species themselves, but also indirectly for the diet of their predators.},

Among the many important roles that habitat plays is as a mediator of ecological interactions, including predator--prey dynamics. In the context of ecosystem restoration, there is great potential to better understand how predator--prey dynamics are influenced by habitat and whether this has implications for how ecosystems are managed. We consider the ways in which habitat serves as an important mediator of interactions between predators and their prey and present four ways in which habitat acts as an intermediary that enhances or diminishes this relationship. We found that habitat provides refuge from predators and shapes the physical traits of prey as they use their surroundings to protect themselves. We also discuss how habitat creates physical resistance and sets the cost of predation for predators and how habitat facilitates apparent competition within a community context. These roles of habitat are well established in ecology, but we believe they are underdeveloped from an applied perspective. We conclude that habitat must be appropriately considered in the context of how it mediates predation. Given the ways that habitat influences predation, restoration efforts should consider if and how physical measures may positively or negatively affect species interactions and whether this could lead to success or failure of overall programs.},

We use optical experiments to demonstrate that these microscopic lenses are able to form images. Light scattering by the polycrystalline lenses is minimized by the use of relatively large, crystallographically-aligned grains. Multi-scale mechanical testing reveals that as the size, complexity, and functionality of the integrated sensory elements increases, the local mechanical performance of the armor decreases. However, A. granulata has evolved several strategies to compensate for its mechanical vulnerabilities to form a multi-purpose system with cooptimized optical and structural functions.},

However, boulder displacement and the geomorphological evolution of boulder beaches driven by different extreme storm events, especially typhoon events, remain poorly understood. Thus, boulder displacement and the geomorphic response on a boulder beach in Fujian, southeastern China, were explored before, during and after a cold wave event (Dec. 1--7, 2020) and before and after Typhoon In-Fa (Jul. 19--27, 2021), a large tropical storm. This was achieved by tracking 42 tagged boulders distributed in the intertidal and supratidal zones using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and topographic surveys using real-time kinematic techniques, respectively. The results showed obvious disparities in boulder displacement in different geomorphic zones due to cold wave and typhoon events that were mainly characterized by migration magnitude, range, direction, and mode of transport. The typhoon event led to rapid and substantial changes in the overall morphology of the boulder beach, while the cold wave event impacted the intertidal morphology of the boulder beach to only a small extent. The surrounding structure of boulders, beach slope and beach elevation had a combined dominant effect on boulder displacement under the same extreme event. Hydrodynamic factors (effective wave energy fluxes, incident wave direction, storm surge and water level) had dominant effects on boulder displacement during different extreme events. In terms of a single event, the magnitude of the boulder displacement driven by the typhoon was much greater than that driven by the cold wave. However, considering the frequency and duration of cold waves in winter, the impact of multiple consecutive cold waves on the geomorphology of the boulder beach cannot be ignored in this study area. Alternating and repeated interactions between these two processes constitute the complete geomorphic evolution of the boulder beach. This study contributes to improved predictions of the morphodynamic response of boulder beaches to future storms, especially large tropical storms, and facilitates better coastal management.},

  abstract = {Urban freshwater ecosystems often involve the introduction of predator species that affect biodiversity via both direct and indirect effects of predation, altering the distribution of prey species. Yet, limited research has explored indirect effects on aquatic invertebrates in urban pondscapes. Here, we use Dytiscidae as our study taxon to investigate how predator-prey interaction modifies the habitat use and habitat selection of macroinvertebrates in ponds of an urban landscape. We sampled dytiscids in 11 ponds with, and 15 ponds without fish, in Helsinki, Finland, during 2018 -- 2020, and emergent plant cover in pond margins as a proxy for the quantity of prey refuges. We found (i) at the pond scale, vegetation cover can mitigate the negative effects of predators on dytiscid species richness and abundance, and dytiscids prefer microhabitats with bulrush and sedges to microhabitats with no vegetation or common reeds, reflecting the importance of providing aquatic plants with high structural complexity as prey refuges. (ii) At the landscape scale, small-sized dytiscids favour fishless habitats, and the community-weighted mean body size of dytiscids has seasonal fluctuations, with smaller body sizes in May and June than in July in fishless ponds, indicating that dytiscids select habitats to regulate their investment in vigilance according to their life cycles. Our findings highlight that predation can alter the habitat use and habitat selection of aquatic invertebrates. Mitigating predation risk at both the habitat scale and the landscape scale is crucial to facilitate the fitness of aquatic invertebrates, especially small-sized species, to promote their diversity in urban pondscapes.},

We used micro-computed tomography combined with quantitative image analysis to reveal the optimized shell geometry to resist force and the aesthetes' global distribution at the whole animal levels to facilitate sense from diverse directions both in the seawater and air. Additionally, shell proteomics combined with transcriptome reveals shell matrix proteins responsible for shell construction and potentially sensory function, highlighting unique cadherin-related proteins among mollusca. Together, this multi-level evidence of sensory units in the chiton shell may shed light on the formation of chiton shells and inspire the design of hard armor with sensory function.},

The difficulty of experimenting on these chitons without causing disturbance means little is known about their ecology despite their importance as a group that often contributes greatly to coastal species diversity. In the present study we measured among-boulder distributional patterns of Ischnochiton smaragdinus, and used time-lapse photography to quantify movement behaviours within different habitat types (pebble substrata and rock-platform). In intertidal rock-pools in South Australia, I. smaragdinus were significantly overdispersed among boulders, as most boulders had few individuals but a small proportion harboured large populations. I. smaragdinus individuals emerge from underneath boulders during nocturnal low-tides and move amongst the inter-boulder matrix (pebbles or rock-platform). Seventy-two percent of chitons in the pebble matrix did not move from one pebble to another within the periods of observation (55--130 min) but a small proportion moved across as many as five pebbles per hour, indicating a capacity for adults to migrate among disconnected habitat patches. Chitons moved faster and movement paths were less tortuous across rock-platform compared to pebble substrata, which included more discontinuities among substratum patches. Overall, we show that patterns of distribution at the boulder-scale, such as the observed overdispersion, must be set largely by active dispersal of adults across the substratum, and that differing substratum-types may affect the degree of adult dispersal for this and possibly other under-boulder chiton species.},

The results are (1) an increase in density with increase in substrate relief, (2) an occurrence of highest densities in moderately exposed and exposed sites rather than in protected ones, (3) an increase in mean size with increase in depth along the intertidal gradient, (4) an increase in both total activity and feeding success on the high water immediately following an extreme minus low tide occurring during the daytime in the summer, (5) a relative restriction of feeding success to that high tide, and (6) a similarity of the diet to the relative abundance of the main observed prey for most areas. The main exceptions are chitons and one lower intertidal limpet, all of which are taken in excess of their apparent abundance and especially in the middle intertidal. The upward extension of some lower intertidal prey populations, such as chitons, may be limited by the increased susceptibility of individuals at the upper margin of the population to predators such asS. dira; susceptibility appears to be increased after periods with a higher probability of increased physiological stress, such as extreme low tides on summer days.},

Some sea stars are specialists. Hippasteria spinosa feeds almost exclusively on a sea pen; Solaster stimpsoni eats holothurians; full-sized Orthasterias koehleri consume the venerid clam Huminilaria; Solaster dazosoni eats its congener S. stimpsoni. Others show remarkably variable diets. In different habitats, Dermasterias imbricate specializes on either anemones, holothurians or sea pens, but within these habitats its diet is consistent throughout the year. The diet of Mediaster aequalis varies with both habitat and season. Pycnopodia helianthoides feeds on sea urchins on rocky substrata but digs clams from sand and cobble. Many other sea stars, including Luidia foliolata, Pteraster tesselatus, Pisaster ochraceus, Evasterias troschelii and Leptasterias hexactis, are quite generalized in their diet and, though often demonstrating preferences in laboratory studies, will feed on a variety of prey determined largely by relative abundance of prey species in the particular habitat. The areal and seasonal variation in the diet of sea stars coupled with the reluctance of some to eat any prey in the laboratory makes extension of laboratory observations to the field diet suspect. Laboratory observations can be used to provide a more detailed understanding of field observations.},

These organisms are disturbed when boulders are moved by waves or buried in sand. Experiments were done to test the hypothesis that these disturbances are responsible for the reduced diversity and abundance of the assemblages on the undersides of small boulders. Boulders on one shore were bolted to the substratum to prevent movement by waves. In two separate experiments on another shore, boulders with and without attached organisms were buried in a few centimetres of sand. All experiments included relevant controls and were done high and low on the shore using rocks of several sizes. The assemblages of algae developing on the tops of all stabilised boulders, regardless of size, were similar to those on boulders free to roll indicating that, in contrast to results elsewhere, disturbance by waves was too infrequent or slight to affect these species. The tops of rocks were also rarely buried in sand and the main influences on the community in this situation were apparently exposure at low-tide and grazing gastropods. More species, however, did settle or survive on the undersides of rocks which were free of sand or could not be moved by waves; thus disturbances were important in this situation. In the absence of disturbance low on the shore, much or all space was occupied and sessile species such as sponges and ascidians overgrew other forms and reduced diversity. This did not happen higher on the shore and here diversity was simply an increasing function of rock-size. Overall disturbance played a similar role in all places -- it killed organisms and created free space -- but the final effects on the community varied depending upon the species present and the actions of other factors.},

  abstract = {Chitons are very common molluscs on European rocky shores. They are common prey of fish and crabs and often display several colour morphs within a given habitat. Predation is one of the potential mechanisms accounting for chiton colour polymorphism. The colour variation is considered to provide a camouflage protection through a match with the substratum surface typology. However, the effectiveness of chiton polymorphism as a predation defence requires further investigation. Previously we found a relationship between chiton colour morphs and substrate characteristics, with chitons most commonly found on substrates that were of similar colour to their shells. Here, we examined whether each morph displayed an active choice for matching the substratum. Next, we assessed if the predation success of the intertidal common crab Carcinus maenas varied significantly with the absence/presence of an apparent camouflage effect created between the chiton colour morph and the substratum type. The present study indicates that chiton colour morphs probably actively choose substratum types where they blend in. Carcinus maenas was able to prey on all Lepidochitona cinereus colour morphs, regardless of the substrate camouflage effect. Surprisingly, the predation frequency was higher on camouflaged chitons than on contrasting chitons. It was concluded that chiton camouflage is probably not a defence mechanism against predation by the crab C. maenas, and that chiton colour polymorphism is probably promoted by other, more visual predators.},

Several abiotic and biotic factors that promote environmental heterogeneity generate physical and biological microhabitats, where organisms may find refuge from environmental stress. The abundance, species richness and body size structure of chiton assemblages were estimated in different intertidal microhabitats. These microhabitats (physical: crevices, pools, and boulders; biological: mussel beds, arborescent algae, and crustose algae) were sampled in six sites of the southern Chilean coast during the austral spring of 2016. The results of our study exhibited the species Chiton granosus as the most abundant, followed by C. magnificus and Tonicia chilensis. Species richness and abundance were higher in physical microhabitats, with boulders and crevices showing the highest values, respectively. The multivariate analyses revealed three groups with high similarities within them; the first group represented by crevices, pools, and mussel beds; the second group composed of arborescent and crustose algae; and the third group comprised by boulders. Mussel beds were considered ``nursery grounds'' for harbouring a high abundance of juveniles of C. granosus ({$<$}10 mm), whilst physical microhabitats and algae host the biggest specimens of both C. magnificus and T. chilensis ({$>$}30 mm). We suggest that in biological microhabitats, the patterns of species richness and abundance and body size structure would be determined by a relation of functional specificity derived from feeding habits; and, in physical microhabitats, these patterns would be explained by a relation of behavioural specificity derived from negative phototactism.},

  abstract = {Any attempt to assess species abundances must employ a sampling design that balances collection of accurate information for many species with a reasonable sampling effort. To assess the accuracy of commonly used within-site sampling designs for sessile species, we gathered cover data at 2 rocky intertidal locations in Southern California using a high-density point-contact method that maintained the spatial relationships among all points. Different sampling approaches were compared using simulated sampling. Different sampling units (single points, line transects, and quadrats) were modeled at high and low sampling efforts. Sampling units were either distributed randomly or with stratified random methods. Sampling accuracy was assessed by comparing cover and species richness estimated by the sampling simulations to the actual field data. Randomly placed single point-contacts provided the best estimates of cover but are usually not logistically feasible in the rocky intertidal, so ecologists typically use quadrats or line transects. With quadrats, some form of stratified random sampling usually gave estimates that were closer to known values than simple random placement. In nearly all stratified cases, optimum allocation of sample units, where quadrats are allocated among strata according to the amount of variability within each stratum, yielded the most accurate estimates. With 1 exception, line transects placed perpendicular to the elevational contours ('vertical transects') approached or exceeded the accuracy of the best stratified quadrat efforts. The estimates for rare species were consistently poor since sampling units often missed such species altogether, suggesting a systematic bias. Species richness was substantially underestimated by all sampling approaches tested, whereas these same approaches accurately estimated diversity (H'). These results illustrate the difficulty of obtaining accurate cover estimates in rocky intertidal communities.},

The aspects of predator-prey relation dealt here are the size and site preference of the predator; the interrelationship between barnacle shell morphology (e.g., shape, external ornamentation) and drilling intensity; and influence of substrate type on body size and shape of barnacles, as well as predation pressure on it. The study reveals that, barnacles are drilled by the naticid gastropods, which is otherwise an uncommon interaction. Drilling intensity on the barnacles attached to a semi-infaunal bivalve, Timoclea imbricata, is exceptionally high and is comparable to the drilling intensity on the host bivalve. Otherwise, predation pressure is very low on barnacles, supporting previous literature. The study implies that unique live-live associations can create opportunities such that even an unusual predator (e.g., Naticidae) can successfully feed on a novel prey (e.g., barnacles), suggesting dietary opportunism. Studies dealing with the fossil record of drillholes should consider these different ecological (e.g., prey selectivity by the predator, host selection by the epizoan, role of unusual predator on an uncommon prey) aspects of drilling predation on barnacles through space and time.},

  abstract = {Homing behaviour is frequently observed in marine intertidal invertebrate species. This behaviour may help species to deal with the environmental variability of the intertidal, providing shelter during low tides and areas to explore and search for food during high tides. The capacity of individuals to show fidelity behaviour should be an adaptive trait, due to the uncertainty that finding a new shelter in each tidal cycle implies. Chiton granosus is a common polyplacophora of the Southeastern Pacific rocky intertidal zone. During high tides, individuals move throughout the substratum in search of food; meanwhile, they are found within crevices in groups of variable sizes during low tides. According to previous works, this species shows some degree of fidelity to these shelters. Using field and laboratory experiments, we herein evaluate the factors determining the degree of site fidelity in C. granosus, taking into account the distance travelled from the shelter and food availability. Also, we evaluated the importance that chemical signs from the pedal mucus have in aiding C. granosus to return to its refuge. Field observations showed that C. granosus presents variable levels of site fidelity covering a maximum distance of 50 cm from its shelter. Laboratory results suggested that fidelity to shelters is related to the proximity of food sources. Chemical cues from the pedal mucus could be used to find the shelter after exploratory activities during high tides.},

By using a predator-detritivore-detritus food chain in bromeliads, we show that predators can increase nutrient cycling by a previously undescribed, but broadly applicable, mechanism: reducing nutrient export by prey emigration. Contrary to expectations, predation on detritivores increases detrital nitrogen uptake by bromeliads. Predation reduces detritivore emergence and hence export of nitrogen from the system. Detritivores therefore benefit their host plant, but only when predators are present. More generally, our results show that predator loss or extinction can dramatically and unexpectedly affect ecosystem functioning.},

  abstract = {AbstractOctopus insularis is a benthic octopod from the tropical and subtropical Western Atlantic Ocean that inhabits semi-permanent ``dens'' (small crevices) in hard substrate. We used visual surveys to assess den occupancy and remote cameras at den entrances to assess activity patterns of O. insularis of South Caicos (21.5112{$^\circ$} N, 71.5190{$^\circ$} W) in the Turks and Caicos Islands (May--August, 2020 and July--December, 2021). Dens were occupied for a median of 4 days, but occupancy ranged widely (1 day--2 months), indicating migration between dens at erratic intervals. The two most prevalent behaviors were Away from the Den, time presumably spent mostly foraging, and Quiescence, when the octopus was sleeping or otherwise unreactive. Our data indicate that Octopus insularis is diurnal, with time Away from the Den peaking between mid-morning (0700--1000) and late afternoon (1600--2000), and with Quiescence peaking at night (2000--0600) and also in the middle of the day (1100--1600), although adherence to this pattern was not strict. High interindividual variation and high within-individual stability in the proportions of time Away from the Den and Quiescent suggest that individuals of this species vary greatly from each other in their hunting and resting patterns, while also showing high levels of internal consistency for at least a week. These observations will guide future research with this commercially important species, further differentiates O. insularis from congeners, and demonstrate the efficacy of minimally disruptive field techniques in studying behavior.},

  abstract = {The feeding habits of the common two-banded sea bream, Diplodus vulgaris, from the eastern Adriatic were investigated with respect to fish size and seasons. Stomach contents of 728 specimens, 12.1-34.0 cm TL, collected by beach seine from 1999 to 2001, were analyzed. Of the total number of stomachs examined, 134 were empty (18.1\%). This percentage varied significantly by season with a maximum number of empty stomachs recorded during the autumn (35.5\%) and a minimum number recorded during the summer (4.5\%). A total of 42 different prey species belonging to eight major groups: Echinoidea, Decapoda, Bivalvia, Gastropoda, Polychaeta, Mysidacea, Polyplacophora and Amphipoda were identified in stomach contents. Echinoidea constituted the main prey (\%IRI = 40.9), especially for fish less than 25.0 cm TL. With fish growth, the proportion of echinoids decreased while that of decapods crustaceans and bivalves increased. The mean weight of stomach contents increased significantly for fish larger than 25.0 cm TL, while the mean number of prey items significantly declined. Diet composition showed a seasonal variation; echinoids were the most important prey item in autumn, winter and spring, whereas decapods were the most important prey item during summer. The lowest intensity of feeding was recorded during spawning (autumn) as well as in a period of lower sea temperature (winter). The mean weight and mean number of prey significantly increased in spring and summer. The results indicate that the common two-banded sea bream feeds on a wide range of prey items and can be considered an opportunistic predator.},

The Cambrian stage of molluscan evolution is characterized based on the paleontological material. The doubtfulness of assignment of the Precambrian (Vendian) soft-bodied fossil Kimberella to mollusks is argued. Judging from the interpretation of the morphologically diverse Cambrian fossils, it is suggested that the classes Polyplacophora, Monoplacophora, Gastropoda and Bivalvia formed already near the Precambrian--Cambrian boundary, i.e., from the beginning of the paleontologically documented evolutionary history of the phylum, whereas the assumption of the later origin of these taxa is unconvincing. The remaining classes of mollusks arose later, i.e., Cephalopoda, in the Late Cambrian; Scaphopoda, in the Ordovician; and Aplacophora, in the Silurian.},

  abstract = {Identification of spatial patterns of species diversity is a central problem in conservation biology, with the patterns having implications for the design of biodiversity monitoring programs. Nonetheless, there are few field data with which to examine whether variation in species richness represents consistent correlations among taxa in the richness of rare or common species, or the relative importance of common and rare species in establishing trends in species richness within taxa. We used field data on three higher taxa (birds, butterflies, vascular plants) to examine the correlation of species richness among taxa and the contribution of rare and common species to these correlations. We used graphical analysis to compare the contributions to spatial variation in species richness by widely-distributed (`common') and sparsely-distributed (`rare') species. The data came from the Swiss Biodiversity Monitoring Program, which is national in scope and based on a randomly located, regular sampling grid of 1km2 cells, a scale relevant to real-world monitoring and management. We found that the correlation of species richness between groups of rare and common species varies among higher taxa, with butterflies exhibiting the highest levels of correlation. Species richness of common species is consistently positively correlated among these three taxa, but in no case exceeded 0.69. Spatial patterns of species richness are determined mainly by common species, in agreement with coarse resolution studies, but the contribution of rare species to variation in species richness varies within the study area in accordance with elevation. Our analyses suggest that spatial patterns in species richness can be described by sampling widely distributed species alone. Butterflies differ from the other two taxa in that the richness of red-listed species and other rare species is correlated with overall butterfly species richness. Monitoring of butterfly species richness may provide information on rare butterflies and on species richness of other taxa as well.},

It was found that crabs and chitons now form the major dietary items when D. antillarum is not available. It is suggested that this predator, which was previously specialized on a single food item, is able to shift resource utilization in the absence of its primary food source, and that the queen triggerfish can capture diverse prey from a wide variety of habitats.},

Naticids seek their prey in the upper layers of the bottom sediment, whereas muricids search for theirs on the surface of the sediment. Naticids only attack living organisms, whereas muricids eat both living animals and carrion. The holes drilled by muricids are mostly smaller than naticid holes and they are more straight-sided. The identification of the group of drills that gave rise to holes in fossil shells is considered a useful criterion in analyzing a micro-sedimentary environment. The concept of paleoethology is defined, in the present connection, as interpreting the attack behavior of drills based on an analysis of the location and nature of drill holes. The present study treats Paleogene ostracodes from subsurface samples in Western Nigeria and living ostracodes and mollusks from the western Niger Delta. By statistical analysis of the hole dimensions it is usually possible to identify the group of predaceous gastropods responsible for the drilling. Valve preference may be shown by naticids in drilling pelecypods but apparently not in drilling ostracodes; this may be connected with the differing mobility of the two groups. An analysis of hole shape is made.},

We used fecal analyses to determine seasonal changes in Harlequin Duck winter diet at a site where Pacific herring spawn. We measured frequency of occurrence and relative abundance by volume of prey remains in 202 fecal samples collected during four date periods in 1998 and 1999. These two measures were highly correlated. We identified snails, crabs, limpets, and chitons as the principal animal prey, and ranked relative importance of most prey types in similar order as previous studies using stomach analyses. Crabs parts constituted the majority of prey remains during molt, and we concluded that crabs were dominant in the diet during molt because crabs generally have greater organic content and less hard-part remains per unit of body mass than other hard-shelled prey consumed at that time. Snail remains were highest in frequency of occurrence during winter. Herring eggs were not detected in feces until a week after herring spawned, but abrupt changes in other prey types indicated that herring eggs were the principal prey throughout the spawn period. Polychaetes increased in importance in winter and spring, and rated third in frequency of occurrence in spring. We recommend using fecal analyses to determine frequency of occurrence of prey in the diet of other sea-ducks that are known to feed on hard-shelled molluscs and crustaceans. Measures of relative abundance of prey remains can be useful if conversion factors relating hard-part remains to whole-body biomass are available.},

It was found in the La Coronilla deposit, a Late Pleistocene invertebrate assemblage from southeastern Uruguay. The drillhole belongs to the ichnospecies Oichnus simplex and is attributed to a muricid gastropod, which could likely have been the ocenebrinid Urosalpinx haneti, recorded in the fossil assemblage. The drillhole features all traits for a predatory origin. However, the rareness of this particular interaction between chitons and gastropods in the fossil record and in the recent, could signify an event of arbitrary drilling.

  abstract = {1 The use of surrogates to identify protected areas is a common practice in conservation biology. The use of top predators as surrogates has been criticized but recently a strong positive relationship was found between the presence of top predators and species diversity of several taxa. As mentioned by the authors, these striking results need to be assessed on a larger scale. 2 We used data from the Swiss Biodiversity Monitoring Programme and the Swiss breeding bird survey to analyse the use of raptor species as a surrogate for plant, butterfly and bird species richness. For each raptor species, we compared species richness in sites where a raptor species was recorded and compared these sites with the remaining sites in which the raptor species was not recorded. For comparison we conducted the same analyses using tits Parus spp. Tits are common prey species of some raptor species and were the most species-rich generalist genus in our data. 3 We found little justification for a focus on top predators when identifying conservation areas. For bird and plant species richness, raptors were reasonable surrogates for high species richness but no raptor species predicted sites with above-average butterfly species richness. 4 The presence of tit species performed equally as well as the presence of raptor species to predict sites with high species richness of birds and plants, and performed even better for predicting high butterfly species richness. 5 Synthesis and applications. Conservation planners using indicator species should be aware that relationships among higher taxa are complex and depend on the species group and the scale of analysis. As shown with the case of raptors, the usefulness of a biodiversity indicator can vary between adjacent areas even if the same species groups are analysed. We recommend the use of more than one indicator species from different taxonomic groups when identifying areas of high biodiversity.},

Amphipods were the most important prey, constituting 62.7\% of the total IRI, followed by gastropods (\%IRI =17.8). The most frequent prey were the amphipod Talitrus saltator (\%IRI = 10.1), the gastropod Monodonta turbinata (\%IRI = 4.6) and the amphipod Gammarus olivi (\%IRI = 3.8).

The snails, Tegula eiseni and T. aureopincta, are patchily distributed on horizontal rocky substrata at depths of 2---10 m off Santa Catalina Island, California, USA. The dominant invertebrate predators in these habitats are the sea stars Pisaster giganteus and Astrometis sertulifera, the whelk Kelletia kellettii, the cephalopod Octopus bimaculatus, and the lobster Panulirus interruptus. Their preferred prey include sear urchins, crabs, and sessile bivalves; the Tegula species are less---favored prey. A positive correlation was found between the abundance of the five predators and that of their preferred nongastropod prey. A negative association was detected between predator density and abundance of all motlile gastropods, prey that tend to rank lower on the preference hierarchies of the predators. The two most common snail species were the Tegula congeners, which comprise 83\% of the gastropod group by number. The spatial distributions of the two Tegula species are not identical. T. eiseni, but not T. aureotincta, is abundant in areas supporting moderate densities of predators. Both species are rare in habitats with high predator densities, and are common where few predators occur. The two Tegula species are known to have defenses against predation that differ from another. T. aureotincta displays a flight behavior in the presence of Pisaster, Astrometis, and Kelletia. No such reaction is elicited when the snail is exposed to rapidly moving unavoidable' predators such as Octopus and Panulirus. T. eiseni does not employ flight defenses, but instead has morphological features that reduce its acceptability as food. Such features are not characteristic of T. aureotincta. These differences in defense probably account for the marked preference on T. aureotincta over T. eiseni by invertebrate predators. Field experiments involving predator and prey manipulations on patch reefs indicate that both emigration and death by predation account for the lack of T. aureotincta in areas with high and intermediate densities of predators. As a consequence of its relatively more effective defense, T. eiseni can persist habitats that contain moderate numbers of predators. The absence of T. eiseni in high predator density areas is the result of direct predation. The dissimilarity in defense mechanisms of the snails accounts for the observed difference in distribution and abundance of the Tegula species. Further, the distribution of predators is correlated with that of their preferred prey. The defenses of the favored prey appear superior to those of motile gastropods, and, as a consequence, the less---preferred gastropod prey are heavily consumed when they occur in the same areas. Although there might be little direct interaction between prey groups, the spatial distribution of preferred pry can thus influence the distribution and abundance of motile grastropods},

  abstract = {1 Because of their popular appeal, top vertebrate predators have frequently been used as flagship or umbrella species to acquire financial support, raise environmental awareness and plan systems of protected areas. However, some have claimed that the utilization of charismatic predators may divert a disproportionate amount of funding to a few glamorous species without delivering broader biodiversity benefits, an accusation aggravated by the fact that the conservation of top predators is often complex, difficult and expensive. Therefore, tests are needed of whether apex predators may be employed to achieve ecosystem-level targets. 2 To test such a hypothesis, we compared the biodiversity values recorded at the breeding sites of six raptor species, differing widely in diet and habitat associations, with those observed at three types of control locations, (i) sites randomly chosen in comparable habitat, (ii) breeding sites of a randomly selected bird species of lower trophic level and (iii) breeding sites of a lower trophic level species with specialized ecological requirements. Biodiversity was measured as the richness and evenness of bird, butterfly and tree species. 3 Biodiversity levels were consistently higher at sites occupied by top predators than at any of the three types of control sites. Furthermore, sites occupied by top predators also held greater densities of individual birds and butterflies (all species combined) than control sites. 4 In a reserve-selection simulation exercise, networks of protected sites constructed on the basis of top predators were more efficient than networks based on lower trophic level species, enabling higher biodiversity coverage to be achieved with a smaller number of reserves. 5 Synthesis and applications. Our results provide evidence of a link between the strategic utilization of top predatory species and ecosystem-level conservation. We suggest that, at least in some biological systems, conservation plans based on apex predators could be implemented to deliver broader biodiversity benefits.},

N. lineata is distinct from N. andamanica (Smith, 1906), based on morphological characters given in the original species description and very distinctly different morphology of aesthete pores in the shell surface. Furthermore, populations of N. andamanica in the Philippines and Solomon Islands are locally colonized with the epibiotic (ectoparasitic) bryozoan Pseudobathyalozoon profundum d'Hondt, 2006. These bryozoans attach ventrally to the girdle of the host chiton and the erect zooids feed within the pallial cavity, among the chiton's gills.},

These include: detrivores, herbivores, omnivorous grazers, carnivorous grazers, specialist spongivores, epizoophagous feeders, xylophagous wood-dwelling species and true predators. The majority of species among common intertidal chitons appear to be omnivorous grazers. Here, we examined the gut morphology, and radula morphology, in species from various feeding types. The proportionate length and mineralization of the radula are not strongly correlated with feeding type, but these characteristics could be refined and later used to exclude particular habits where no other ecological data are available. Gut length in chitons follows classical gut foreshortening, with ambush predators having a short intestinal tract forming a single major loop, whereas obligate herbivores having dramatically long intestinal lengths with multiple coilings. Multiple feeding strategies, and concomitant adaptation of the digestive system, can be observed among phylogenetically closely-related taxa. Niche partitioning through dietary specialization, even among co-occurring omnivorous grazers, may speculatively underpin the success of chitons in the Northeast Pacific and other regions.},

  abstract = {Marine deposits of sunken wood provide an important habitat for deep-sea biota, including an extensive wood-endemic invertebrate fauna. These habitats are important in their own right; many species on organic falls are not able to survive in other deep sea ecosystems. Evolutionary transitions of species among various chemosynthesis-based ecosystems does not proceed deliberately from organic falls toward hydrothermal vents. Polyplacophoran molluscs (chitons) are generally rare in deep-sea systems but are found in comparatively high diversity and abundance on tropical sunken wood. A new timecalibrated phylogeny for the predominantly deep-sea order Lepidopleurida shows the chiton lineages found in sunken wood habitats do not comprise a single clade or radiation, but represents a minimum of three independent radiations in the Pacific alone. Most marine invertebrate groups diversified in the deep sea following the end Cretaceous extinction event; by contrast, sunken-wood chitons may have persisted in these habitats for longer than other animals. Fossil chitons from the early Carboniferous (ca. 350 Mya) have strong similarities to modern wood-endemic taxa, yet the common ancestor of living Lepidopleurida occurred much later in the Triassic and did not apparently rely on woodfall. Clades within Lepidopleurida that occupy wood habitats in the tropical Pacific probably arose in the Jurassic, which corresponds to evidence from the fossil record, but with an additional separate colonisation more recently in the early Paleogene. Wood-endemic chiton species encompass multiple independent evolutionary origins of co-occurring wood species, and these separate lineages correspond to differences in micohabitat and feeding strategies. These patterns demonstrate the ongoing evolutionary linkages between terrestrial and deep marine environments, and the opportunistic adaptations of deep-sea organisms.},

  abstract = {Highly mobile aquatic predators are known to forage in the intertidal during periods of immersion. There is limited quantitative information, however, on the extent to which these predators influence the abundance of grazing molluscs which are known to have a key role in structuring intertidal assemblages. Our preliminary video observations revealed that crabs and small fish were abundant on shores in southwest England during high-tide. We then used manipulative experiments to quantify the effect of small mobile aquatic predators on the abundance of limpets (Patella vulgata L.). On the lower shore at two moderately sheltered rocky shores three treatments were established: complete cage, partial cage (cage control) and uncaged (natural condition). The complete cages excluded all predators. The partial cage treatment allowed full access to small predators and the uncaged treatment allowed access to all predators. After two months, limpet abundance in uncaged and partial cage treatments had declined by around 50\% compared to the complete cage treatment. Population structure also changed with survival of larger individuals being greater than smaller individuals in the open and partial cage treatments compared to the complete cage treatment. The effects of excluding predators were consistent at small (meters) and large spatial scales (kilometres) and hence, it would appear that the outcomes of our research are generally applicable to similar shores in the region. To explore the mechanism behind the differential effects of predators according to prey size, we compared the detachment force required to remove limpets of differing sizes from the shore. This was around four times greater for larger individuals than for smaller ones indicating that smaller limpets were more vulnerable to predation. These effects were also consistent between locations. Subsequent laboratory observations showed that the crabs Carcinus maenas (L.), Necora puber (L.) and Cancer pagurus (L.) which are locally abundant predators of limpets, had differing handling behaviour but were all highly efficient at removing limpets from substratum. Hence, shell width and attachment force appeared to be critical factors influencing the vulnerability of limpets to predation by these crabs. Limpets are known to control the abundance of macroalgae on shores in the North-east Atlantic and so our conclusions about the role of mobile predators in regulating the abundance of these grazers are important to our broader understanding of the ecology of these shores.},

Here we use the intertidal crab Eriphia verrucosa (Forsk{\aa}l) as a model species to examine patterns of association between functional morphology (cheliped size and form) and patterns of prey consumption on shores of differing exposure to wave action. The size and form of the cheliped of crabs are known to be related to feeding performance and thus influence the outcomes for prey assemblages. Multivariate analyses showed that the claw size and shape of E. verrucosa varied between shores of differing exposure to wave action. Individuals from exposed locations had larger claws than those from sheltered locations. This shift in size was accompanied by differences in the composition of stomach contents between locations. Crabs from exposed shores had {$\sim$} 55\% more hard shell prey (mussels and limpets) in their diet than those from sheltered shores. Crabs were more abundant on sheltered shores, but those from exposed locations were larger in carapace width. The relative abundance of prey varied between shores of differing exposure. Patterns of claw functional morphology provided a mechanistic explanation for the differences in prey consumption along the wave exposure gradient, although it remains to be tested whether there is a phenotypic plasticity response of crab claw to patterns of prey consumption. The interaction between prey abundance and morphology of the cheliped will likely shape the diet of this crab species, and this may have implications for the relative impact of this predator between shores of differing exposure.},

  abstract = {Linkages between predators and their prey across the subtidal-intertidal boundary remain relatively unexplored. The influence of tidal phase, tidal height and wave exposure on the abundance, population structure and stomach contents of mobile predatory crabs was examined on rocky shores in southwest Britain. Crabs were sampled both during the day and at night using traps deployed at high tide and by direct observation during low tide. Carcinus maenas (L.), Necora puber (L.) and Cancer pagurus (L.) were the most abundant species, being mainly active during nocturnal high tides. C. maenas was the only species that was active during nocturnal low tides, when it was observed mainly on the lower shore feeding on limpets. Individuals of all 3 species sampled during high tide were considerably larger than those sampled during low tide. Thus, sampling crab populations at low tide is likely to underestimate abundance and the extent of predation by crabs on rockyshore assemblages. During immersion, the relative abundance of each species was influenced by exposure to wave action and tidal elevation. All species were more abundant on the lower shore; C. maenas and N. puber were more abundant in sheltered locations, while C. pagurus was more abundant in exposed locations. Analyses of stomach contents from individuals captured at high tide revealed that chitons and limpets were the most common hard-shell prey taxa in the diet of these predators. The relative abundance of prey in gut contents was, however, not correlated with patterns of prey abundance. Our study indicates the importance of crabs as key intertidal predators and illustrates the strong trophic linkages between the subtidal and intertidal zones, which is likely to be a key factor influencing community structure on European shores.},

In the Mediterranean Sea, very little information is available on its feeding habits and ecological functions. Here, its increasing abundance and the ability to actively prey on a keystone sea urchin species suggest potential repercussions for the structure and functioning of benthic communities. We performed laboratory feeding experiments to investigate interactions between Mediterranean H. carunculata and 12 species of sessile or sedentary invertebrates. H. carunculata preyed efficiently on 9 of the species offered. In particular, active predation of a polychaete upon nudibranchs, colonial ascidians and chitons was reported for the first time. Fireworms' predatory ability may be due to a combination of several `weapons' (large size, motility, stinging chaetae and eversible, sucking pharynx) which seems to be unique among marine worms, and could enable H. carunculata to persist also after radical changes in prey community composition and withstand selective pressures associated with ongoing environmental changes.},

We found that O. wendtii orients to large ({$\geq$}50\>deg), high-contrast vertical bar stimuli, consistent with a shelter-seeking role and with photoreceptor acceptance angles estimated from morphology. We calculate poor optical sensitivity for individual photoreceptors, and predict dramatic oversampling for photoreceptor arrays. We also report responses to dark stimuli moving against a bright background -- this is the first report of responses to moving stimuli in brittle stars and suggests additional defensive uses for vision in echinoderms. Finally, we found that animals missing a single arm orient less well to static stimuli, which requires further investigation.},

The diets of seven species and two subspecies were investigated by gut content analysis of over 1400 specimens from a number of localities from the Red Sea to the western Pacific. Two species, D. grossularia and D. lobata, are sipunculan specialists, whilst D. morum and D. rubusidaeus mainly eat eunicid polychaetes. Drupa ricinus and probably D. elegans feed upon a wide variety of prey including crustacea, vermetid gastropods, chitons, polychaetes and sipunculans. The Red Sea subspecies D. ricinus hadari also eats small gobiid fish. Drupa clathrata clathrata, probably the least advanced species in the genus, has a diet of molluscs and barnacles, similar to that of other thaiid gastropods.},

  abstract = {Patterns of feeding in a population of Heliaster helianthus (Lamarck), a common and dominant species of starfish indigenous to the Pacific South American coast, were investigated in an intertidal habitat in central Peru from October 1986 to April 1987. The H. helianthus population comprised individuals of 3.5 to 30.2 cm body size (diameter) with two modal size classes. The number of rays ranged between 18 and 40, and individuals with 31 to 33 rays accounted for ca. 42\% of the total population. There was a higher rate of increase in ray number with body size amongst small individuals({$<$}13.0 cm diam). H. helianthus is capable of feeding on more than one prey item at a time (average of 5.6 to 13.2 prey items handled, with several predators observed to hold {$>$}100), and both the number of prey individuals captured and the total prey biomass were significantly correlated with predator size. Amongst a total of 1132 feeding observations, the largest number of predators (an average of 85.4\% of those feeding) were preying on the mussel Semimytilus algosus whilst another mussel, Perumytilus purpuratus, ranked second with 21,9\% of predators feeding. The proportion of S. algosus in the diet increased from 65.4\% in the smallest predator size-group ({$\leq$}10.9 cm diam) to 91.2\% in the largest ({$\geq$}19.0 cm). In contrast, P. purpuratus and barnacles were more highly represented in the diet of small H. helianthus. The smallest size-group ({$\leq$}10.9 cm) had low dietary overlap with larger sizes and less specialized prey utilization. Two geographically separated populations of H. helianthus in Peru and Chile showed contrasting patterns of prey utilization. S. algosus and P. purpuratus comprised 85.5 and 6.5\% by number in the diet of the Peruvian population, respectively, whilst corresponding figures for the Chilean population were 8.3 and 60.5\%, with barnacles attaining a higher share (22.6\%). However, the total number of prey individuals per feeding predator was almost the same in Peru and Chile, with 10.0 and 10.7 individuals, respectively. H. helianthus individuals of different sizes occupy slightly different microhabitats within the intertidal area, which, coupled with differential spatial distribution of prey species, results in the predator population being able to utilize a wide range of resources.},

A. scabra is a food generalist and scavenger with a diet composed mainly of molluscs and crustaceans belonging to more than 60 genera. The diet was dominated numerically by chitons and trochid molluscs. Several site-specific differences in dietary composition were apparent. Only Ischnochiton maorianus was a numerically important prey species at all study sites. Dietary diversity and evenness were more or less constant and comparable both seasonally and geographically. The proportion of intertidal seastars feeding fluctuated during the study from a peak of 42\% in January to 23.7\% in June 1976. Prey species were consumed in proportions independent of their abundance. In the laboratory, A. scabra, free of ingestive conditioning, discriminated between different prey species and preferentially consumed I. maorianus. There were strong prey preferences at the specific, but not at the familial, level.},

  abstract = {The behavior of the octopus when feeding upon shelled molluscs is described in four steps: selection of prey, boring a hole in the shell, secreting into the borehole, and pulling out the body oC the mollusc and eating it. Selection of some gastropod prey is determined by a firm, deep, either partial or complete obstruction in the aperture of the shell. Selection of other prey, gastropods, pelecypods, and amphineurans, may be based upon resistance by the mollusc to the application of force by the octopus. Drilling of the hole is done by the radula. Since the octopus will drill and secrete into empty shells with obstructions in the apertures, metabolites from a live mollusc are unnecessary. This technique can be usedto collect the secretion. The frequency of occurrence and the eflect of the secretion are discussed. The hypothesis that the octopus first tries by force to pull out the body and, failing to do so, drills a hole in the shell is experimentally supported.The conditions under which the octopus drills or pulls out the body of the mollusc are incompletely understood. The octopus may drill two or more shells in succession without feeding upon the previously drilled and weakened snail. No two steps in the behavioral sequence are necessarily linked to each other. The drilling-feeding patterns are complex and plastic.},

Here, we assess the importance of prey depletion as a driver of large carnivore endangerment globally using lists of prey species for each large carnivore compiled from the literature. We consider spatial variation in prey endangerment, changes in endangerment over time and the causes of prey depletion, finding considerable evidence that loss of prey base is a major and wide-ranging threat among large carnivore species. In particular, the clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), Sunda clouded leopard (Neofelis diardi), tiger (Panthera tigris), dhole (Cuon alpinus) and Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis) all have at least 40\% of their prey classified as threatened on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List and, along with the leopard (Panethra pardus), all of these species except the Ethiopian wolf have at least 50\% of their prey classified as declining. Of the 494 prey species in our analysis, an average of just 6.9\% of their ranges overlap protected areas. Together these results show the importance of a holistic approach to conservation that involves protecting both large carnivores directly and the prey upon which they depend.},

  abstract = {Many aquatic invertebrates adjust their behavior to the degree of predation risk, which can be inferred from various sensory cues. We assessed the ability of the hermit crab Pagurus minutus to process different types of cues during predator avoidance and to discriminate between predators and non-predators by measuring the length of time that the hermit crabs remained retracted within their shells (hiding time) after exposure to visual cues, chemical cues, or both. Video images were used as visual cues, and water from aquaria holding predators or non-predators were used as chemical cues. The predator species was the portunid crab Charybdis japonica, and the non-predator species was the hermit crab Clibanarius infraspinatus. Natural seawater and background video were used as controls. Test individuals were exposed to each cue for 100~s. Both visual and chemical predator cues significantly increased hiding time in comparison to the controls, whereas non-predator cues did not significantly affect hiding time, indicating that P. minutus can discriminate between predators and non-predators from both visual and chemical cues. However, exposure to visual and chemical cues simultaneously did not significantly lengthen hiding times in comparison to exposure to a single cue type, indicating that there is no dominance in risk hierarchy between visual and chemical cues, and that P. minutus integrates information from both types of cues as if they were a single cue. We discuss the differences in our results from those previously obtained with a similar experimental design for the hermit crab P. granosimanus.},
